# constellation-engine

Constellation is an open-source dependency reasoning engine designed to explain how failures propagate through complex systems.

It models systems as dependency graphs and combines deterministic analysis with bounded AI reasoning to surface blast radius, fragility, and architectural risk — with correctness, reliability, and security as first-class concerns.
